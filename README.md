# Simple Linear Regression Neural Networks using Numpy

This repository contains Neural networks right from the basics using Numpy to create random inputs, noise, weights and bias.
 
we will build the model, generate and feed it random data and then train the model. We expect the Machine Learning Algoritm to learn the underline relationship of the data. The objective function and the optimization Algorithm were also addressed in this notebook.

## A few things to try and to take note
Increasing the number of observations (e.g. to 100,000) did not make difficult the learning processs of the algorithm as it gave about the same loss for the iterations as compared with the initial 1000 observations but it took more time to run.
Reducing the Learning rate to Values like 0.005, 0.0005 reduces the time needed for the loss to converge or to be minimized to zero. And so the Learning rate is inversely proportional to the numbers of iterations because more iterations will be required to get minimum loss.
